# BEngine
### BEngine is an open-source modular game engine built on top of the monogame framework

**CURRENTLY VERY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT**
BEngine was created for me as an alternative to unity. It is meant to give developers a high level of control over their games and the engine used to make them.

**MODULES INCLUDED**
- [BCORE](https://github.com/Bish0pdev/BCore) - BCore contains the base ECS classes for objects in BEngine, and utilities to allow other modules to function properly
- BPhysics (Planned)
